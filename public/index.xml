      <description>Back to blogging  Link to heading   Hey! I finally found a glimpse of motivation to come back into blogging. About C++, architecture and other things. At first I may repost all my previously created blogs in this github page based blog, as I lost my previous website due to inactivity.
I would like to thank some of you who supported me into going back into blogging. Some liked my blogs, made me very happy, and now I am back to write more.</description>

      <description>Hello, my name is Quentin Balland, 29 years old.
I am a french c++ developer currently living in Switzerland and working as a C++ software engineer.
I like software development which made me want to begin this blog and go into development experimentation while sharing it with you. With the hope I can make people learn from my experience but mostly to learn from you all and get the better of your eventual comment about my content.</description>
