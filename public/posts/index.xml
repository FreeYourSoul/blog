      <description>Back to blogging  Link to heading   Hey! I finally found a glimpse of motivation to come back into blogging. About C++, architecture and other things. At first I may repost all my previously created blogs in this github page based blog, as I lost my previous website due to inactivity.
I would like to thank some of you who supported me into going back into blogging. Some liked my blogs, made me very happy, and now I am back to write more.</description>

      <description>Conference Report: ACCU 2019  Link to heading   I had the pleasure to attend to the ACCU2019 in Bristol which was my first cpp centred conference (the first of a long series I hope :p) and it was amazing in a different aspect.
It is a 4 days conference that occurs every year between March and April in the Marriott hotel in Bristol.
Amazing people, very inclusive and easy to talk to everyone!</description>

      <description>The First architecture part-1  Link to heading   Data-Oriented Design  Link to heading   We directly begin with one of the topics I took most of my time working on. For the people not familiar with Data Oriented Design (DoD), I will try explaining it in this post. But I will also give several links to content that are, I think, needed in order to grasp the importance and power of DoD in C++.</description>

      <description>FyS : introduction and idea  Link to heading   What is FreeYourSoul concept, where did the idea come from ?  Link to heading   Basically, the idea was just to have a big project, that would force me to cover and explore multiple subjects into depth, and to improve in a lot of different aspect of software engineering and in the C++ language itself. The project began in late 2017, and I wanted to try the new features of the C++ standard.</description>
