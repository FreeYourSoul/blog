      <description>Back to blogging  Link to heading   Hey! I finally found a glimpse of motivation to come back into blogging. About C++, architecture and other things. At first I may repost all my previously created blogs in this github page based blog, as I lost my previous website due to inactivity.
I would like to thank some of you who supported me into going back into blogging. Some liked my blogs, made me very happy, and now I am back to write more.</description>
