# Back to blogging

Hey! I finally found a glimpse of motivation to come back into blogging. About C++, architecture and other things.
At first I may repost all my previously created blogs in this github page based blog, as I lost my previous website due to inactivity.

I would like to thank some of you who supported me into going back into blogging. Some liked my blogs, made me very happy, and now I am back to write more.

## What will I write about?

I will certainly continue on FreeYourSoul online, my MMORPG. I thought about some interesting things to implement, and maybe some other languages to experiment (but I do intend to keep a strong focus on C++); rust maybe.. well I did try it a bit and have been disturbed by many things while trying to practice the language, certainly because of my C++ background or I am too rigid and have a hard time fighting the rustc compile.. Well I am digressing.

I will try implementing new interesting ideas in the MMORPG that would make the project a tiny bit more unique and interesting to observe. But I will certainly talk about it into more details in later blog posts.

Hope you will enjoy reading my articles.
